# KEG specification

Knut is a keg app that sticks to the KEG specification as much as possible. See rwxrob's keg spec[^11] for more information. Any places where it differs should be documented here.

For more information about KEG see Rob Muhlestein's spec for keg[^11].

## Markdown specification

I don't follow the KEGML spec to a tee for several reasons. I like using prettier and it conflicts with KEGML.
