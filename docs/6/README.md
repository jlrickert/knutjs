# Typical usage strategies and tips for a keg

For a bit more context how where I consume and add to a keg I use an android phone and a Mac Book pro. My setup on my laptop consists of kitty, zsh, tmux, and neovim. See my dotfiles[^6] for more information.

- Searching by title

  Typically, I will open up the dex/changes.md file and use the builtin search functionality of vim to search.

- Chronologically sorting nodes

  One of the things that I needed is a way to have nodes chronologically ordered and be able to search for like things. The typical things where I use this strategy is for daily entries and for baking. As I add a new entry I will manually add the entry to the index to the top. This is similar to changes.md does. For new nodes what I typically do is add date entry date (Y-m-D) format and add a tag. At some point I want to automate this[^6](../13)

- Searching by context

  If you don't have a search engine available for searching you notes and don't remember enough detail about the node you are looking for it can be challenging to find. Often times what I do is to include links to like nodes at the bottom of the README.md file. I then use the links to jump between nodes until I find the thing that I need. This requires a bit a forethought on what to include links too.
