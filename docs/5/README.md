# How to read the documentation

The documentation uses the keg format for documentation. It is a format specified by Rob Muhlestein[^5.1] for his own take on a modern zettelkhasten. For how to use it see what is a KEG and how to use it[^5.2].

Its aim is to be a documentation format aimed at power users.

The documentation follows the KEG spec[^5.1]. See [index](../dex/changes.md) for a list of all nodes and there titles.

Here is a list of some of the most interesting ones
